# where to start crawling. host names must end with /, eg. http://127.0.0.1/
# multiple start points can be provided, one per line, each line ending with \
# and next line starting with |.
# 
# example:
# startURLs=http://127.0.0.1/\
# |http://www.localhost.com/

startURLs=http://127.0.0.1/

# restrict visits to urls matching this regex. default: everything under the startURLs
#includePattern=

# among the included urls, exclude those matching this regex. default: no exclusions
# example: excludePattern=http://127.0.0.1/news/.*|http://127.0.0.1/sports/.*
# excludePattern=

# scan mode: just visit the URLs provided in the file (one URL per line). 
# if a filename is given here, crawling will be disabled.
# urlFile=urllist.txt

# all content matching the regex here will be subject to link extraction. default: no extraction.
# example: extract=text/html|text/plain
extractPattern=text/html

# when doing link extraction, the text that is captured by this regexp will be regarded as a link
# example: link=href=\"(.*?)\"|src=\"(.*?)\"
linkPattern=href=\"(.*?)\"

# the response body of all content types matching this regex will be stored on disk. default: no content will be stored.
# example: storePattern=text/html|application/x-javascript
storePattern=text/html

# the user agent.
userAgent=

# specify cookie handling, with an option to ignore cookies. 
# load balancers often use cookies to ensure session stickyness, thus ignoring cookies will make requests 
# spread out across the load balanced servers.
# Default: true (cookies are handled like a normal browser does)
# useCookies=true

# specify whether the crawler should follow redirects. if true, only the final URL
# (after redirect) will be logged. Default: true
# followRedirects=true
